**Link to project:** https://react-stripe-homepage.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, APIs

## Lessons Learned:

- How to set global context for the whole application

- How to build and implement dynamic modal windows that grow and shrink dynamically depending on the number of items it displays 

- Adjust the position of modal windows by using the build in method getBoundingClientRect() which returns the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport. Using the properties returned by this method I learnt how to calculate the center of the element and position the modal window exaactly below the element I wanted it to be displayed at.
